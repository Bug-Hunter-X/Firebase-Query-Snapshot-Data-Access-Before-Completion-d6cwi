This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase when accessing data from a query snapshot before the query has fully resolved. The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, leading to undefined errors. The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected approach using promises or the `.onSnapshot` listener for asynchronous operations. This ensures that data is accessed only after successful query completion, preventing unexpected errors and enhancing application stability.  For further details, refer to the Firebase documentation on asynchronous operations and data retrieval.
